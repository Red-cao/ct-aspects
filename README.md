### Content

-  [data:](https://github.com/simonsf/ct-aspects/tree/main/data) this folder contains five subjects along with whole processdure.

-  [DenseNet.py:](https://github.com/simonsf/ct-aspects/blob/main/DenseNet.py) contains the structure of our model.

-  [WeightedMSE.py, ](https://github.com/simonsf/ct-aspects/blob/main/WeightedMSE.py) [AvgLoss.py, ](https://github.com/simonsf/ct-aspects/blob/main/AvgLoss.py)[RankLoss.py:](https://github.com/simonsf/ct-aspects/blob/main/RankLoss.py) implements difference loss functions used in our training processing.

-  [train_cortical.py:](https://github.com/simonsf/ct-aspects/blob/main/train_cortical.py) contains the functions to train the network, and also needs to be fitness to your task and data with some changes.

-  [test.py:](https://github.com/simonsf/ct-aspects/blob/main/test.py) contain the functions to test the trained model, and also needs to be fitness to your task and data with some changes.

- [config.py:](https://github.com/simonsf/ct-aspects/blob/main/test.py) contain configurations during the training.

### Requirement

This repository is based on PyTorch 1.1.0, developed in Ubuntu 16.04 environment. 


-  cuda (required by pytorch), cudnn, numpy, scipy, sklearn, tqdm, pillow, matplotlib, ipython.

-----------------------

Note that due to potential commercial issue, the trained model on large dataset was not included.
